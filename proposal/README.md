# Project: SJSU Foodie App
#### Team #2: Elena Ilic, Manasi Nekkar, Robert Veloya

## Issue:
Difficulty identifying items on local restaurant menus that are compatible with certain dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, etc). 

### Previous Works:
!Any relevant previous work? otherwise, delete

### Operating Environment:
!Potentially: app-based, ios?

## Description:

## Functionality: 
By implementing an application that takes input from users (similar to a recommendation system) we can create a "database" of local menu items and what dietary restrictions they might adhere to. This can then be viewed to see what menu items are compatible with the user's personal potential restrictions.

## Operations:
App user: interacting with system <br />
-write review: write a review to be uploaded to the foodie "database" <br />
-view restaurants: view all restaurants in an area <br />
-select restaurant: select the desired restaurant <br />
-select item: select the desired items <br />
<br />
Foodie: serving user requests <br />
-upload review: upload the user's review to be uploaded <br />
-show restaurants: show the user the list of participating restaurants <br />
-show menu: display a restaurants menu to the user <br />
-show review: display an item's results to the user <br />
