## Functionality:
- Our project helps users find restaurants close to campus that have food items for their specific diet (i.e, vegetarian, vegan, halal, etc)
- Once the user creates their account, they are immediately asked for their food preferences. There is a button on the homepage, where they can edit their preferences. 
- In the homepage, we have a list of several different restaurants that fit their criteria. The user can also see specific menu items that fit their dietary restrictions. Users can view other people's reviews as well as leave the reviews for the restaurants. 
- For the safety of our users, we have implemented several password requirements that must be met. For example, passwords must be at least 8 characters, contain at least 1 uppercase letter and lowercase letter, and must have a special character. <br />
