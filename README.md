## Functionality:
- Our project helps users find restaurants close to campus that have food items for their specific diet (i.e, vegetarian, vegan, halal, etc)
- Once the user creates their account, they are immediately asked for their food preferences. There is a button on the homepage, where they can edit their preferences. 
- In the homepage, we have a list of several different restaurants that fit their criteria. The user can also see specific menu items that fit their dietary restrictions. Users can view other people's reviews as well as leave the reviews for the restaurants. 
- For the safety of our users, we have implemented several password requirements that must be met. For example, passwords must be at least 8 characters, contain at least 1 uppercase letter and lowercase letter, and must have a special character. <br />

## Operations: 
- First, the user should run the LoginFrame page. This page greets the user with our Welcome Page. Here, the user should be able to login in, if they already have an account, or sign up, if this is their first time. 
- In the SignUp Page, the user should enter their username and password. The password must be at least eight characters, contain at least one number, special character, uppercase letter, and lowercase letter. Error messages will pop if these conditions are not met. Once the username and password is entered in and accepted, the user is guided to the next page.
- The next page allows the user to input their dietary preferences. For example, they want to find restaurants with keto and vegetarians. Once they have chosen all options that are applicable, they press the done button, leading them to the Foodie homepage. 
- The homepage welcomes the user and lists their dietary preferences. Additionally, the homepage shows the restaurants that fit the criteria.
