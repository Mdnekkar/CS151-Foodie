## Functionality:
By implementing an application that takes input from users (similar to a recommendation system) we can create a "database" of local menu items and what dietary restrictions they might adhere to. This can then be viewed to see what menu items are compatible with the user's personal potential restrictions. User input also allows for accuracy in restaurant menu items and dietary offerings. The application offers a view of local restaurants and the like, where the user can look at specific menu items and the ratings and reviews left behind by previous users. <br />
